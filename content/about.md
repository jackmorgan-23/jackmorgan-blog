I am a Computer Science student at UNH specializing in **Cybersecurity**. 

My passion lies in understanding how systems work at a low level—from assembly instructions to kernel memory management. I believe that to defend a system effectively, you must first understand how to break it.

### Tech Stack
* **Languages:** C, Assembly (Intel 64), Python, JavaScript
* **Tools:** Parrot / Kali Linux, Wireshark, GDB, valgrind
* **Interests:** Low-level Programming, Large Language Models (LLMs), Ethical Hacking

When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time on the beach with my two dogs, and rock climbing at the gym.
